            <p>OHAYO our Memeber!</p>
            

            <p>We invite you to purchase with Drive O'Connor used cars premium drives. We ensure us that we give atleast 5 months of warranty for the car that you have purchased. 
                You just need to approach us and book the car that you wish to buy.</p>

            <p>Firstly mail us which car you would like to buy with our Gmail I'd which I mentioned below each car that you are hovering around and
                 mail us the required car and we will send you the details that you are wishing to buy.
                If you are interested again for that drive remail us again so that we would confirm a test drive and a direct conversation between the seller and you and we will be also present at the place where this takes place.</p>


            <p>After that you would need to pay an advance amount of only 10,000 through our portal and that amount is not refundable. 
                So please ensure that you are 100% percent confident on your decision.</p>
